Architecture:

interface: HTML and CSS(cursor)
    HTML: 1 main div and 9 child div (width 1/3 of the parent);
        FLEXBOX:
         display: flex-wrap: wrap;
         2 players( x and 0)


         

    Javascript

    Functionality:

         EventListener
         switching between players
         check for winning
         DOM manipualtion: players turn, winning message
         start again button


   Questions:
         how we store the positions that have been chosen:
         given that we have a small matrix of only 9 numbers and only 8 winning combinations, I will refer to each cell by its ID.

         how to know if a user won:
         conditionals if
         after each gameplay we are going to check whether any player has one of the winning combunations;
